# 100daysofcode
Hi there!

I'm taking part in the 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp by Udemy and I'm documenting my progress and learning journey on GitHub. I'm thrilled to be taking this bootcamp as it covers all the essential concepts of Python programming and provides hands-on experience to apply the learned concepts.

The course covers topics such as data structures, functions, object-oriented programming, web development using Flask, working with databases and much more. With each day, I'm learning something new and challenging myself to apply what I've learned in real-world projects.

In this repository, you'll find all the code I've written during the 100 Days of Code challenge, along with explanations and descriptions of the concepts I'm learning. I hope that this repository will serve as a helpful resource for anyone who is looking to learn Python or improve their skills.

So far, the bootcamp has been a fantastic experience, and I'm excited to see where it takes me in the next 100 days. I'm confident that by the end of the challenge, I'll have a solid understanding of Python programming and be able to build projects on my own.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue my journey through the 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp!
